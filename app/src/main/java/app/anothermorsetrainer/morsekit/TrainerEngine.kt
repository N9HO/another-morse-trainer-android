/**
 * The decision-making core of the trainer. It chooses which character to
 * play next, builds the multiple-choice question (correct answer plus the
 * closest-sounding distractors), records each result with its TTR, and grows
 * the active character set as the learner gets fast and accurate.
 *
 * It holds no audio or UI — that lives in the app — so all of this logic can
 * be unit-tested on its own.
 *
 * Translated from MorseKit/TrainerEngine.swift. Swift's injectable
 * `RandomNumberGenerator` becomes Kotlin's `kotlin.random.Random` (default
 * `Random.Default`, or a seeded `Random(seed)` in tests); `private(set) var`
 * becomes `var … private set`. The `Codable` [Snapshot] is simplified to a
 * plain holder + [snapshot]/[restore] (kotlinx.serialization would wire real
 * persistence, mirroring the Swift custom encode/decode).
